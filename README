# QML bindings for native Android controls

## Requirements

- Qt 5 dev (5.6.0)
- Android 5.x
- Gradle

## Installation

Build like any Qt module. It might be necessary to run 'make
install' in 'src/java' until the build system is finalized.

## Qt Creator

When building the example in Qt Creator, tick "Use Gradle" in

    Projects -> Build & Run -> Build Steps -> Build Android APK

## Notes

The Android 5.x dependency is not going to stay. Proper Android
version handling is just missing for the time being. The goal of
the hackathon project was to create a visually stunning demo.
