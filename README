# QML for Android

QML wrappers for native Android controls.

## Introduction

This is a former Qt hackathon project born in November 2014.
Credits for the original idea and the groundwork go to Attila Csipa:

## Requirements

- Qt 5.4 or later
- Android 5.x
- Gradle

## Installation

Build and install like any Qt module. For developer builds, it's
necessary to run 'make install' in 'src/java' until the build system
quirks are fixed.

## Qt Creator

When building the example in Qt Creator, tick "Use Gradle" in

    Projects -> Build & Run -> Build Steps -> Build Android APK

## Notes

The Android 5.x dependency is not going to stay. Proper Android version
handling is just missing for the time being. The goal of the hackathon
project was to create a visually stunning demo, not a polished product. ;)
