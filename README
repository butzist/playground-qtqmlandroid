# QML for Android

QML wrappers for native Android controls.

## Introduction

This project was forked from:
https://github.com/qtproject/playground-qtqmlandroid

This is a former Qt hackathon project born in November 2014.
Credits for the original idea and the groundwork go to Attila Csipa:

## Requirements

- Docker

## Installation

- Build and run Docker container
  docker build -t qtqmlandroid docker/
  docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/build -w /build qtqmlandroid

- Execute build in container:
  ./docker/build.sh

## Notes

The Android 5.x dependency is not going to stay. Proper Android version
handling is just missing for the time being. The goal of the hackathon
project was to create a visually stunning demo, not a polished product. ;)
